# Arabic-Sentiment-Analysis
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Arabic reviews using neural network models. We cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by removing punctuation, stop words, and unnecessary English words, and translating text where needed. For modeling, we used a Transformer and a Bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM). The BiLSTM model captures the context of each review from both directions, while the Transformer model uses advanced attention mechanisms to improve accuracy. Our experiments showed strong performance, and we tuned parameters to achieve the best results possible, reaching high accuracy scores on our sentiment predictions.
