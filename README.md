# Arabic-Sentiment-Analysis
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Arabic reviews using neural network models. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed by removing punctuation, stop words, and unnecessary English words, with translation applied where needed. For modeling, a Transformer and a Bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) were used. The BiLSTM model captures the context of each review from both directions, while the Transformer model uses advanced attention mechanisms to improve accuracy. Experiments showed strong performance, and parameters were tuned to achieve the best possible results, reaching high accuracy scores on sentiment predictions.
